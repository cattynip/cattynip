# Plan for my coding journey

These are the plans for my coding journey. This plan has two main parts: TodoPlans and Timeline Plans.

Todo Plans are my general plans that can be done whenever I can accomplish them throughout my whole life. That is also why I specified my plans' time pretty roughly, not specifically, and they are not treating only computer programming.

Timeline Plans are the very specific plans that should be done at that time by me. Because there are tons of days, months, and years for me to live and do computer programming, I divided them into years and four parts in one year. I usually do not work on multiple projects. I wrote the time frame in each section and added detailed information below it. As much as nobody knows what will happen to them, I do not, obviously. So, I will keep adding more content that has yet to exist for now.

## Todo Plans

- [ ] Build all my [Cattynips Series](https://github.com/stars/cattynip/lists/cattynips) after graduation from Albert College and before entering university.
- [ ] Get into [The University Of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/) or [MIT](https://mit.edu/)
- [ ] Be a member of [Craft](https://craft.do) when I have to get a job.
- [ ] Build a house where I can live after retirement.
- [ ] Write a book, which can be a tiny guide to be like me, after I feel like I am successful enough.## Timeline Plans
