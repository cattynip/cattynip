## Who Am I?

Hello, I am [Seol SO](https://cattynip.dev), konwn as Cattynip from South Korea, and a ninth grade student at [Albert College](https://albertcollege.ca). I have been dreaming of being a computer programmer, creating value to the society by developing things for customers. Why? Because I love Writing Codes and Building Services. I always keep the phrase `Learn Anytime, Write Anywhere.` in my mind to embark on the right path.

## What Technologies can I use?

- Languages: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, TypeScript, SASS, Python, Dart
- Libraries: PugJS, ReactJS, ChakraUI, ThreeJS, Framer Motion
- Frameworks: NodeJS, ExpressJS, NextJS, TailwindCSS, Flutter
- Database: MongoDB, MySQL
- ORM: Prisma
- Package Managers: NPM, Yarn
- Version Control System: Git and Github

## How Do I Code?

I always work with my friend, [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/), no any type of IDEs. [This repository](https://github.com/cattynip/dotfiles) has my NeoVim, Fish Shell, and the other development environment settings. So you can check and clone it.

## What Plan Do I Have?

You can see my plans for the future in [this](./plan.md) README file.

## Who Do I Respect?

I personally respect [Jong Min Kim](https://blog.cmiscm.com/?page_id=3023), who has been working at Google for ten years. The biggest reason I respect him is that his videos inspired me in the diverse ways, brought me my dream and suggested me to sutdy and do computer programming.

## What Do I Want To Achieve?

1. Build my portfolio website
2. Get into [the University Of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/) or [MIT](https://mit.edu/)
3. Join to the top companies, such as Apple, Google, or Tesla
4. Be a member of [Craft](https://www.craft.do/careers)
